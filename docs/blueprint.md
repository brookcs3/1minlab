# **App Name**: Lab Write-Ups

## Core Features:

- Lab 1 Display: Display Lab 1 write-up with code snippets, narrations, expected outputs, and troubleshooting steps.
- Lab 2 Display: Display Lab 2 write-up demonstrating NumPy for audio processing, volume operations, and 18-slice analysis.
- Lab 3 Display: Display Lab 3 write-up showcasing librosa STFT and spectrograms, including visualization and round-trip reconstruction.
- Lab 4 Display: Display Lab 4 write-up with PyTorch setup checks, NumPy-to-tensor conversions, and pipeline integration.
- Lab 5 Display: Display Lab 5 write-up focusing on the U-Net architecture and complete integration for audio separation.
- Markdown Rendering: Render all write-ups from markdown.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0C4FF) to represent technical clarity and readability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to ensure optimal contrast and readability of code and text.
- Accent color: Teal (#70B8B8) for call-outs and important annotations within the lab write-ups.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a clean, technical feel, suitable for titles.
- Body text: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for excellent readability, optimized for long passages of text. Should be paired with Space Grotesk
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for clear display of code snippets.
- Divide sections clearly by Lab number and names. Use containers or cards to visually group lab write-ups and reduce vertical space. Consider using subtle clip art or icons related to the lab content to add visual interest without overwhelming the user.
